# CurrentLimiter
This project uses Arduino, a MOSFET, and an ACS712 current sensor to limit current. The code monitors the current drawn by a load and disconnects power when it exceeds a set limit, ensuring component safety. Features include real-time monitoring and efficient power control using PWM signals.
